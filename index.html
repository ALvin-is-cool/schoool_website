                    <p>I'd wish I could give this movie a 5 star rating but there's a few things that didn't make that happen first of all we can already tell that this was heavily inspired by toy story and trolls and I feel like this would of been a bit better if there was just a little bit more effort and originality put into this movie. But love the message of the movie which is "love yourself and our flaws makes us who we are" and I CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH I love when movies give that message because there's millions of people struggling with self care and the fact that it's directed towards children makes it better. Also may I add that I LOVE THE CHARACTER DESIGNS?! They're adorable! yeah it kinda defeats the whole point of "UglyDolls" But imagine if they were actually "Ugly" that would honestly be a little terrifying if you think about it and especially since it's directed towards children. but ye overall this is an awesome movie and I enjoyed it a lot despite some of the flaws it has! </p>
